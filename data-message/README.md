# SDMX-JSON Data Message

SDMX-JSON Data Message is a SDMX data exchange format based on JSON. JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used standardised lightweight data-
interchange format.

SDMX-JSON Data Message works together with the SDMX RESTful Web Services API. It
will assist developers to write software that requests data responses in JSON
from SDMX RESTful API and processes the data and metadata in the JSON response
in order to produce data visualizations in web. SDMX-JSON Data Message focuses
on data visualisation and it supports all features of the SDMX RESTful API for
data queries.

The proposed format conforms to the JSON standard specification, and it supports
the SDMX 2.1 Information Model and the full functionality of the SDMX 2.1
RESTful API for data queries for various types of visualisations. SDMX-JSON
format is streamable from a supporting web service in order to limit the amount
of server resources. It should provide fast responses from a web service: few
roundtrips, small message sizes and fast parsing. In addition, the format aims
to ease the development of client applications with a simple, but generic
message structure that supports different types of data structures.
